    "bio": "Louis Armstrong was the most influential figure in jazz history, fundamentally transforming the music from collective improvisation to a soloist's art form. Born in New Orleans in 1901, he developed his revolutionary trumpet style through work with King Oliver and Fletcher Henderson before forming his legendary Hot Five and Hot Seven groups in the 1920s. His innovative trumpet playing combined unprecedented technical virtuosity with emotional depth, while his distinctive gravelly voice and charismatic stage presence made him jazz's first true superstar. Armstrong pioneered scat singing, influenced countless musicians across all genres, and remained a beloved entertainer until his death in 1971. His recordings from the 1920s remain cornerstones of American music.",

    "bio": "Edward Kennedy 'Duke' Ellington was a visionary composer, pianist, and bandleader who led his orchestra for nearly 50 years, creating an unparalleled body of work. He composed over 1,000 pieces ranging from three-minute masterpieces like 'Mood Indigo' to extended suites like 'Black, Brown and Beige,' transcending the boundaries between jazz and classical music. Ellington's genius lay in writing specifically for his sidemen—Johnny Hodges, Harry Carney, Cootie Williams—treating his orchestra as a single instrument with unique tonal colors. His Cotton Club residency in the late 1920s brought him fame, but his creativity never waned, producing landmark albums even into the 1960s. Widely considered one of the greatest composers in American music history, his influence extends far beyond jazz into the fabric of 20th-century music.",

His virtuosic technique, innovative use of chord extensions, and lightning-fast runs over complex harmonies created a new vocabulary for improvisation that musicians still study today. Parker's genius emerged from Kansas City's jam session culture, and by his early twenties, he was revolutionizing jazz at clubs along 52nd Street in New York. Despite struggling with heroin addiction throughout his career, he recorded prolifically for Savoy and Dial labels, producing masterpieces like 'Ko-Ko,' 'Ornithology,' and 'Confirmation.' His death at 34 robbed jazz of its most innovative voice, but his musical DNA lives on in virtually every saxophonist who followed.",

Known for his bent trumpet, puffed cheeks, and ebullient personality, he balanced virtuosity with showmanship and humor. Gillespie mentored countless young musicians and led State Department-sponsored tours that spread jazz worldwide, remaining a vital force in music until his death in 1993.",

Davis had an extraordinary gift for assembling legendary bands—his sidemen included John Coltrane, Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, Tony Williams, and Keith Jarrett. His spare, lyrical trumpet style prioritized space and emotion over technical display, influencing musicians far beyond jazz. A cultural icon who collaborated with Prince and appeared on MTV, Davis remained artistically restless until his death in 1991.",

His 'sheets of sound' technique—rapid arpeggios cascading through chord changes—became his signature, while albums like 'Giant Steps,' 'My Favorite Things,' and 'A Love Supreme' are considered sacred texts of jazz. Coltrane's classic quartet with McCoy Tyner, Jimmy Garrison, and Elvin Jones produced some of the most powerful music in jazz history. His death from liver cancer at just 40 ended a career of unprecedented artistic growth, but his influence on subsequent generations remains immeasurable.",

His angular melodies, dissonant harmonies, and percussive attack stood in stark contrast to the flowing bebop style, yet his compositions—'Round Midnight,' 'Straight, No Chaser,' 'Blue Monk'—became jazz standards. Monk was a house pianist at Minton's Playhouse where bebop was born, but his music always stood apart, full of unexpected silences, whole-tone runs, and cluster chords. After years of obscurity and a wrongful cabaret card revocation, he achieved major recognition in the late 1950s with Riverside and Columbia recordings that revealed his genius to a wider audience. His influence extends beyond jazz into avant-garde and art music, proving that originality trumps convention.",

Coleman's self-taught approach and plastic alto saxophone produced a raw, vocal-like tone that divided audiences: some heard noise, others heard pure emotion. His theoretical concept of 'harmolodics'—treating melody, harmony, and rhythm as equal—influenced everyone from Pat Metheny to punk rockers. Coleman continued exploring through electric bands like Prime Time, classical compositions, and collaborations until his death in 2015, remaining one of music's most fearless innovators.",

    "bio": "Sonny Rollins is a tenor saxophonist whose massive sound, thematic improvisation, and uncompromising artistic standards have made him jazz's greatest living legend. His 1956 album 'Saxophone Colossus' established him as Coltrane's equal, featuring the calypso 'St. Thomas' which became his signature tune. Famous for his sabbaticals—including a period practicing on the Williamsburg Bridge walkway to avoid disturbing neighbors—Rollins has repeatedly withdrawn from the scene to reassess his music. His improvisations are architectural marvels, building on motifs and developing themes with a logic that connects him to Coleman Hawkins and the saxophone's deepest traditions. Now in his 90s, Rollins remains revered as a musician who never stopped challenging himself.",

Brubeck studied with classical composer Darius Milhaud and brought European ideas about polytonality and counterpoint into jazz. His college campus tours in the 1950s helped establish jazz as serious art music for a new generation. Brubeck continued performing and composing into his 90s, receiving the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and influencing countless musicians with his intellectual yet accessible approach.",

Baker's struggles with heroin addiction led to prison time in Italy and years of obscurity, yet he repeatedly returned with music of startling beauty. His later recordings, with their weathered voice and economical trumpet, carry a melancholic depth that speaks of hard-won wisdom. Baker's death from a fall in Amsterdam in 1988 ended a turbulent life, but his influence on the sound of jazz romance endures.",

    "bio": "Max Roach was a drummer and composer who helped create bebop and spent his entire career pushing jazz forward while advocating for civil rights and Black dignity. His work on Charlie Parker's revolutionary recordings established new possibilities for jazz drumming, while his quintet with Clifford Brown produced hard bop masterpieces. Roach's 'We Insist! Freedom Now Suite' was a landmark political statement that used music to protest segregation and apartheid. He explored percussion ensembles, collaborated with rappers, and taught at the university level, always insisting that jazz was serious music deserving respect. His virtuosic technique, compositional sophistication, and activist consciousness made him one of jazz's most complete artists.",

His quintet with Max Roach produced a string of classic albums, while his ballad playing set new standards for beauty and emotional depth. Unlike many of his contemporaries, Brown lived clean—no drugs, no alcohol—making his death in a car accident even more cruel.

    "bio": "Roy Ayers is a vibraphonist whose jazz-funk innovations with Ubiquity made him one of the most sampled artists in hip-hop history. Starting as a hard bop vibraphonist influenced by Milt Jackson, Ayers pivoted to funk in the 1970s, creating a sound that merged jazz sophistication with danceable grooves. Songs like 'Everybody Loves the Sunshine' and 'Running Away' became hip-hop building blocks, sampled by artists from A Tribe Called Quest to Mary J. Blige. Ayers' warm vibes tone, smooth vocals, and positive energy created a template for contemporary jazz-influenced R&B. Now in his 80s, he continues performing and has seen his influence acknowledged by generations of musicians who grew up on his sampled legacy.",
